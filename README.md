## Usage

To use and run the DVC pipeline install the `t5s` package

```

pip install t5s

```

Firstly we need to clone the repo containing the code so we can do that using:

```

t5s clone 

```

We would then have to create the required directories to run the pipeline

```

t5s dirs

``` 

Then we need to pull the models from DVC

```

t5s pull

```

Now to run the training pipeline we can run:

```

t5s run

```

Finally to push the model to DVC

```

t5s push

```

To push this model to HuggingFace Hub for inference you can run:

```

t5s push_to_hf_hub

```

Next if we would like to test the model and visualise the results we can run:
```

t5s visualize

```
And this would create a streamlit app for testing
